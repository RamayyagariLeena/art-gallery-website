### What I learned
I found this challenge to be quite demanding, perhaps one of the most challenging ones I've encountered so far. Additionally, I seized the chance to explore a JavaScript library for the first time, integrating maps using 'Leaflet.' It was an enriching experience, and I'm thrilled by the outcome of this remarkable challenge.
